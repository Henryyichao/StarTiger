## Why do I apply MSc Political Sociology Programme?

The way life world works is a big puzzle for me. Growing up in a State-owned enterprise family area, all my early life is in the track of political sociology. I have heard my father participated in combat corruption investigation against the ex-chairman. I have witnessed the community decaying with the waning of steel industry. I have seen the biggest church in my neighborhood removed. The labor-captial relations, the economy-community relaitions, the state-religion relations began lingerd on my mind. During the instinctive observation, I start to stepped in the core area of political sociology unconsciously.

The acedemic world open the door when I review my reading list of ten years. All this contents was flowing, converging into the sea of Political Sociology. After viewing all related programmes, *Rerum cognoscere causas*, the motto of LSE, really touched the deepest part of my being. 

LSE has the distinguished reputation of social science research, which is the solid foundation of this interdisciplinary research. Bertrand Russell, Friedrich Hayek and Fei Xiaotong, the wise men of LSE is the most breathtaking school admission advertisement. Not to say the 18 Nobel prizes. I was fascinated by their mastery and eager to join them. Moreover, LSE has the most diversified students background. That would provide me with different world views and different think methods, which is crucial for the social science study. Furthermore, I love the teaching style of LSE. It really fascinated me when my colleague from LSE described the class of negotiation, high official who have real experience arrange the real task of Brexit negotiation, And the outcome of the class is also serve to the real negotiation. The border of theory and practice is blurred. Students are encouraged to figure out the big question and to improve the society. That indeed my dream.

Therefore my decision is rooted in my life, both passionate and deliberative, LSE is the holy space where I can dedicate to my research and fulfill my dream.

## Why am I the ideal student?

I am equipped the most strong acedemic awareness among my peers. On the beginning is the ability of asking questions. Proposing good questions is critical for a graduate student. After 5 years trainning of following all the news around world,  deep understanding of the issue priority is cultivated. Maybe calling it sociological imagination is more precise. My topic always was the most-praised in my company. I was also invited to Renmin universty, to deliver lectures about how to find good questions. For example,Why government struggle to allocate pension across provinces? Why the post-neoliberism reform in France are doomed? How to break the education dilemma of China? What is the nature of the power we faced everyday? I am mesmerized by this critical topics. Second is the awareness of deploying papers. All the literature means the accumulation of human knowledge. Therefore I will search papers in my work even daily life. I insist on writing professional analysis with the help of journal articles and dissertations. Even it is related to the abstruse topic like mechanics. There is no exaggeration in saying that though I left the university 5 years ago, I always keep in touch with acedemic circles.

Academic methods is my second advantage. Using method is the most distinguished  ability of a student. Some qualitative method is accompanied with my work. In 2012 I have conduct a social survey and win the first prize on the provincial level. In 2017 I tried a participant observation in Dungan village in  Kazakhstan. In 2019 I have tried unstructured Interview with 7 former Chinese ambassadors, generate a story of foreign policy history of PRC. While I also master in quantitive methods. From the education institutions, I mastered in statistics, python, R , SQL and Tableau. Regression analysis and basic machine learning is familiar to me,  For example I have deployed a model to  research the [social network of the extremist](https://slides.com/houyichao/deck-1/live#/). Then use python and tableau to illustrate the [Mobike usage](https://public.tableau.com/profile/henry8017) condition in Shanghai. I graduated from a median university and used to feel embarrassed to talk about my Alma *Mater*. However, when I got skillful in such academic method. It struck me that I am powerful enough to break such stereotype or stigma.

Third advantage is academic innovation. Innovation ability is not born talent nor hard-work fruit. It just like chemical reactions. I just happen to have many 'Chemical elements'. Apart from my major history, I was well-informed in sociology, microeconomics, anthropology, psychology and philosophy. All their methods and scopes may contribute a lot to the political sociology research. For example, Benedict Anderson applied literature material like poem and novel as evidences to explain nationalism. Philip George Zimbardo analyzed how to persuade people with the social factors by many psychology experiments. Not to say I have a roadmap of innovation—citesapce. To get the landscape of political sociology, I download 2300 papers of *American Sociological Review* from web of science, then generated a knowledge network through co-citation analysis ([report](https://www.houyichao.com/article/2019-06-07%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E5%AD%A6%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E5%9B%BE%E8%B0%B1/)). It shows the academic frontier and the bursts point, Which lead the innovation. Thus, I am full confident about this part.

Last but not least, acedemic resources is also extremely important for a scholar. In that dimension I own several types of resources. The literature resouces was hold by powerful bibliographic management software Zotero. From 2018, I have download 4844 items and classified clearly in that. With the exercise of paper-reading in the open mind club, these skills increase my research efficiency significently. The Interviewee resources is my core engine for research. Working in Ifeng New Media which is specialize in Chinese politics for almost 5 years, I have interviewed the Chief Negotiator for China’s accession to the WTO—Long Yongtu and dozens of academics. Besides I have come into contact with almost 80 grassroots officials, which enable me to peer the processing of political system behind the curtains. Finally, I manage a Wechat Subscriber which affect 1.6 million reader's political attitudes, such response endow me a special insight of Chinese public opinion field.These are quite precious sources for political sociology study. 

## What is my plan after graduate?

The study in LSE must be an intense and full experience. In the course I will endure a strict academic training, combining my experiences and  resources, then a high-quality research would appeared. 

Besides, the links I have in LSE will empower me lot. I believe my insight would be more penetrating and have a clear understanding of Chinese society. With these abilities, I believe being a analyst of think tank, a statesman of  public administration or a political journalist would be my career calling(Beruf). Actually, two of my collegues are LSE gruduate, Song Dongze and Tang yang, and They both set an good example for dedication and professionalism.

Beyond that I have dreamed of starting an organization to facilitating the China reform in political area. After comprehend the Chinese society in a clear way, and then my dream will come true gradually.

I long for the day when I come back, have the confidence of proposing useful advice to my officer friends, and persuading friends in the Chinese People's Congress. Instead just repeat other scholar's idea like a parrot, we can find the proper way to fulfill the happiness of 1.4 billion compatriots. And if the cost of society progressive can be reduced, it would be the greatest honor for me.

So that is the end of my personal statement. Give me a miracle, I will repay a miracle.
