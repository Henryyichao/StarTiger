## Why do I apply MSc Political Sociology Programme?

The way life world works is a big puzzle for me. Growing up in a State-owned enterprise family area, I have witnessed the decaying of prosperous community, friends relocating to big cities, parents running a grocery laboriously like British workers in 18th century, our fate changing generation by generation rapidly. During the instinctive observation, I start to explore the force which manipulate our life.

*Rerum cognoscere causas*, the motto of LSE, have motivated me for many times. When basking in the sun of Bertrand Russell's, Friedrich Hayek's and Fei Xiaotong's thought, I realize that they explain the world beautifully, I am fascinated by their mastery and eager to join them.

And why Political sociology?I can't imagine my academic tracks until combed my reading list of ten years, most of them can be classified in the category of Political Sociology. Which finally confirmed my academic interest.

Why Political Sociology Programme in LSE? She has the distinguished reputation of social science research, which is the solid foundation of this interdisciplinary research. It really touched me when my collegue from LSE described the special academic style which mixing theory and practice.LSE told me that to figure out the social force is the first step, to improve the society is more inspiring target. Besides, the diversity of students is most enviable in the G5 so that would provide me with different worldviews and different think methods, which is crucial for the social science study. 

Therefore, my decision is both logical and deliberative, which combine academic interests and knowledge dream. I am proud of it.

## Why am I the ideal student?

This is a median student who can believe himself. I graduated from a median university of China, for a long time I feel embarrassed to talk about my Alma *Mater*, for it tend to be a signal of incompetence. Then I realized that is just a stereotype or stigma based on probability. if one guy was devoting to research and had chance, then nothing would stop him. What's more, that experience provide me with a civilian perspective, which is a compromise of the arrogant elite one and the angry proletariat one, that maybe the base of sociological imagination. 

This is a student with clear question awareness. Only experienced actual social life, can a student really find his/her big questions in sociology. 5 years ago, I have no idea of what to study, many topics seems too big to explore. But when I start interview and field work, I can feel the concrete force which pushed me. I experienced the reform of household registration system, that unshackled 200 million citizens can enjoy the happiness of free migration including me. Then everything become unlocked or 'aletheuein' to me. Then I would catch so many inspiring qustions from the daily flow. Why government find hard to allocate pension across provinces? Why the post-neoliberism reform in France are doomed? How to break the education dilemma of China? What is the nature of the power we faced everyday? I am mesmerized by this critical topics. Such impulse is far more strong than students who have not stepped out of ivory tower. This is believed to be the Force that can help me fulfil the study with passion.

This is a student with full academic potential. As a white collar editor with burdensome task, he could insist on writing professional analysis with the help of journal articles and dissertations. Even in the abstruse area like  mechanics, I can soak the content of various papers quickly. Which may partly owe to the powerful bibliographic management software Zotero. What's more, to get the landscape of political sociology, I download 2300 papers of American sociological review from web of science, Then generate a knowledge network through co-citation analysis(report). Which make me clear about what is the  trends and where is the tipping point. Such scientific tools not only increase my research efficiency, but also boost the possibilities of innovation.  Such key preparations for postgraduate research is ready.

This is a student with multiple perspectives. Except my major history. I was well-informed in sociology, microeconomics, anthropology, psychology and philosopy. All their topics and scopes may contribute a lot for the political sociology research. For example, Benedict Anderson applied literature material like poem and novel as evidences to explain nationalism. Philip George Zimbardo analysed how to persuade people with the social factors by many psychology experiments. I agree with that if a scholar want to figure out a question, limiting it in one single subject is not enough. Therefore the various backgrounds maybe the advantages for the researchers like me. Let alone LSE is also a great stage for every student,  who want to break the hard boundry of disciplines.

This is a student who have many research resources. I have been working in Ifeng New Media which is specialize in Chinese politics for more than 4 years. I have interviewed the Chief Negotiator for China’s accession to the WTO—Long Yongtu and several insightful diplomats, academics. As a political editor, the most precious opportunity is that I have come into contact with almost 100 grassroots officials, enable me to peer the processing of political system behind the curtains. What's more, the instinct of Journalist made me skillful in information collecting. Such skills are popular when I deliver lectures in famous Renmin university. 

This is a student who master programming skills for research and illustration. I have participate the Data analyze course from 2016-2019, which sharpen my statistics skills such as regression analysis and basic machine learning. Familiar with Python, R, SQL and their packages, I can deal with multi analyze task. For example I have deployed a model to  research the [social network of the extremist](https://slides.com/houyichao/deck-1/live#/). Then use python and tableau to illustrate the [Mobike usage](https://public.tableau.com/profile/henry8017) condition in Shanghai. I believe that would be extremely useful when I conduct some quantitative research. Such talent showed during my college life, in 2012 I organized a social survey team and conducted the core analyse part with SPSS, then the report accept the renown prize of Hubei province.In 2014 I my junior fellow apprentice win "Challenge Cup" National College Student Curricular Academic Science and Technology Works Competition with the same topic, which is the highest prize in China. 

## What is my plan after graduate?

The study in LSE must be an intense and full experience. In the course I will endure a strict academic training, combining my experiences and  resources, then a high-quality research would appeared. 

Besides, the links I have in LSE will empower me lot. I believe my insight would be more penetrating and have a clear understanding of Chinese society. With these abilities, I believe being a analyst of think tank, a statesman of  public administration or a political journalist would be my career calling(Beruf). Actually, two of my collegues are LSE gruduate, Song Dongze and Tang yang, and They both set an good example for dedication and professionalism.

Beyond that I have dreamed of starting an organization to facilitating the China reform in political area. After comprehend the Chinese society in a clear way, and then my dream will come true gradually.

I long for the day when I come back, have the confidence of proposing useful advice to my officer friends, and persuading friends in the Chinese People's Congress. Instead just repeat other scholar's idea like a parrot, we can find the proper way to fulfil the happiness of 1.4 billion compatriots. And if the cost of society progressive can be reduced, it would be the greatest honor for me.

So that is the end of my personal statement. Give me a miracle, I will repay a miracle.
